           # Set frame size
           #
           # As an input option, this is shortcut for the VIDEO_SIZE private option,
           # recognized by some demuxers for which the frame size is either not stored

-partitions +parti4x4+partip8x8+partb8x8 
           # One of H.264's most useful features is the ability to choose among 
           # many combinations of inter and intra partitions. 
           # P-macroblocks can be subdivided into 16x8, 8x16, 8x8, 4x8, 8x4, and 4x4 
           # partitions. 
           # B-macroblocks can be divided into 16x8, 8x16, and 8x8 partitions. 
           # I-macroblocks can be divided into 4x4 or 8x8 partitions. 
           # Analyzing more partition options improves quality at the cost of speed. 
           # The default is to analyze all partitions except p4x4 (p8x8, i8x8, i4x4, b8x8), 
           # since p4x4 is not particularly useful except at high bitrates and 
           # lower resolutions. Note that i8x8 requires 8x8dct, 
           # and is therefore a High Profile-only partition. 
           # p8x8 is the most costly, speed-wise, of the partitions, 
           # but also gives the most benefit. Generally, whenever possible, 
           # all partition types except p4x4 should be used.

-subq 5 
           # 1: Fastest, but extremely low quality. 
           #    Should be avoided except on first pass encoding.
           #
           # 2-5: Progressively better and slower, 
           #      5 serves as a good medium for higher speed encoding.
           #
           # 6-7: 6 is the default. 
           # Activates rate-distortion optimization for partition decision. 
           # This can considerably improve efficiency, though it has a notable speed cost. 
           # 6 activates it in I/P frames, and subme7 activates it in B frames.
           #
           # 8-9: Activates rate-distortion refinement, 
           # which uses RDO to refine both motion vectors and intra prediction modes. 
           # Slower than subme 6, but again, more efficient.
           #
           # An extremely important encoding parameter which determines 
           # what algorithms are used for both subpixel motion searching 
           # and partition decision.

-trellis 1 
           # 0: disabled
           # 1: enabled only on the final encode of a MB
           # 2: enabled on all mode decisions
           #
           # The main decision made in quantization is which coefficients to 
           # round up and which to round down. 
           # Trellis chooses the optimal rounding choices for the maximum 
           # rate-distortion score, to maximize PSNR relative to bitrate. 
           # This generally increases quality relative to bitrate by about 5% 
           # for a somewhat small speed cost. It should generally be enabled. 
           # Note that trellis requires CABAC.

-refs 1    # One of H.264's most useful features is the abillity to reference frames 
           # other than the one immediately prior to the current frame. 
           # This parameter lets one specify how many references can be used, 
           # through a maximum of 16. 
           # Increasing the number of refs increases the DPB (Decoded Picture Buffer) 
           # requirement, which means hardware playback devices will often 
           # have strict limits to the number of refs they can handle. 
           # In live-action sources, more reference have limited use beyond 4-8, 
           # but in cartoon sources up to the maximum value of 16 is often useful. 
           # More reference frames require more processing power because 
           # every frame is searched by the motion search 
           # (except when an early skip decision is made). 
           # The slowdown is especially apparent with slower motion 
           # estimation methods. Recommended default: -refs 6

-coder 0   # CABAC is the default entropy encoder used by x264. 
           # Though somewhat slower on both the decoding and encoding end, 
           # it offers 10-15% improved compression on live-action sources and 
           # considerably higher improvements on animated sources, 
           # especially at low bitrates. 
           # It is also required for the use of trellis quantization. 
           # Disabling CABAC may somewhat improve decoding performance, 
           # especially at high bitrates. CABAC is not allowed in Baseline Profile. 
           # Recommended default: -coder 1 (CABAC enabled)

-me_range 16  # MErange controls the max range of the motion search. 
              # For HEX and DIA, this is clamped to between 4 and 16, 
              # with a default of 16. 
              # For UMH and ESA, it can be increased beyond the default 16 to 
              # allow for a wider-range motion search, 
              # which is useful on HD footage and for high-motion footage. 
              # Note that for UMH and ESA, increasing MErange will 
              # significantly slow down encoding.

-minrate 800k 

-maxrate 800k # Specifies the maximum bitrate at any point in the video.
              # Requests the VBV buffersize to be set. This option is generally used
              # when encoding for a piece of hardware with bitrate limitations.

-bufsize 800k # Depends on the profile level of the video being encoded.

-rc_eq 'blurCplx^(1-qComp)'

-bt 200k   # Allowed variance of average bitrate

-i_qfactor 0.71 # Qscale different between I-frames and P-frames. 
                # Note: -i_qfactor is handled a little differently than -ipratio.
                # Recommended: -i_qfactor 0.71

-level 30 

-keyint_min 25  # Minimum GOP length, the minimum distance between I-frames. 
                # Recommended default: 25

-g 25  # Keyframe interval, also known as GOP length. 
       # This determines the maximum distance between I-frames. 
       # Very high GOP lengths will result in slightly more efficient compression, 
       # but will make seeking in the video somewhat more difficult.
